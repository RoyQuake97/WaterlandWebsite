🔧 UI Improvements
Unified Card Design

Use a consistent border radius, padding, and shadow across all cards.

Remove rounded header tab (with the stars) or blend it better with the card.

Add subtle hover animation (e.g., elevate card slightly or glow subtly on hover).

Profile Avatars

Display round user avatars fetched from Google when available, falling back to initials.

Make avatars clickable to open original Google review (in a new tab).

Star Rating Display

Use a cleaner star system (flat vector-style, gold or yellow tone).

Show half-stars where applicable (e.g., 4.5 → ★★★★½).

Better Text Handling

Don’t truncate too early. Use 3-line preview and ellipsis. Show “Read more” only if needed.

Animate “Read more” expansion inline rather than linking.

Date Formatting

Use natural language for recent reviews:

“a week ago” → “Last week”

“8 months ago” → “Summer 2024”

Or show exact date: “Reviewed on July 12, 2024”

Color and Contrast

Switch the green “5★” badge to a neutral or gold tone.

Avoid blue-on-blue (in Read More buttons) — ensure enough contrast for readability.

Use a white/light card with soft shadow for elevated look.

Mobile Optimization

Make cards swipeable horizontally on mobile.

Limit display to 3–4 cards and allow users to swipe for more.

User Feedback

Add a thumbs up “Was this helpful?” under each review.

Optional: enable emoji reaction at bottom of each card.

🔌 Integration with Google Maps API
To ensure your reviews are synced directly and filtered for only high-quality ones:

API Filter

Use Google Places API to fetch real-time reviews.

Filter by rating >= 4 or review.rating >= 4 to display only 4-star and 5-star reviews.

Custom Sort Logic

Prioritize latest 5-star reviews (sort by date, descending).

Optionally use helpful count if available from API for sorting.

Auto-Update

Schedule API pull daily or weekly to update live reviews.

Append “Last updated” timestamp like you already have.

🧠 Bonus Features
Carousel Slider: Add autoplay carousel with dots to preview multiple reviews smoothly.

Featured Review: Highlight one 5-star review with large text and photo at the top.

Review Snapshot Bar:

Display a summary with a rating bar (e.g., 80% 5★, 15% 4★, etc.).

"Write Your Review" CTA:

Link to Google review form directly (preloaded with your place ID).
