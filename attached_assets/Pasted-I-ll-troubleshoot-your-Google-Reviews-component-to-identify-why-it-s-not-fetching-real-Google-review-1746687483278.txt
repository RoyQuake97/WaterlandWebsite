I'll troubleshoot your Google Reviews component to identify why it's not fetching real Google reviews. Let me analyze the code systematically.
Key Issues Identified
After examining your EnhancedGoogleReviews component, I've identified several issues that could be preventing the component from fetching real Google reviews:

Missing API Integration: The code attempts to fetch data using React Query, but doesn't specify an actual API endpoint.
Missing API Client Setup: There's no Google Places API or similar service configured to actually retrieve the reviews.
No Error Handling for API Responses: The component expects a specific data structure but doesn't handle potential API response errors.
Missing Backend or API Proxy: To fetch Google reviews, you typically need a backend service that makes the API calls with your credentials.

Let me explain these issues in more detail and provide solutions:
1. Missing API Endpoint Configuration
The React Query configuration doesn't specify a real endpoint:
javascriptconst { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery<ReviewsData>({
  queryKey: ['/api/reviews'],
  staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
});
This configuration is missing the actual queryFn that makes the API request.
2. No Google Places API Integration
The code doesn't have any Google Places API integration, which is typically necessary to fetch Google reviews. You need to:

Set up a Google Cloud project
Enable the Places API
Create an API key
Make requests to the Places API (typically on a backend)

3. Data Structure Handling
Your component expects a very specific data structure:
typescriptinterface ReviewsData {
  name: string;
  rating: number;
  url: string;
  reviews: Review[];
  fetched_at: string;
  is_stale?: boolean;
}
But if you're not receiving this exact structure from your API, the component will fail.
Solutions
Here's how to properly integrate Google reviews:
1. Create a Backend API Endpoint
You need a server-side API endpoint that:

Makes requests to the Google Places API with your API key
Formats the response to match your frontend expectations
Handles rate limiting and caching

Example backend route (Node.js/Express):
javascript// On your backend
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/api/reviews', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Your place ID from Google Maps
    const placeId = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID';
    
    // Make request to Google Places API
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?place_id=${placeId}&fields=name,rating,reviews,url&key=YOUR_API_KEY`
    );
    
    // Format the response to match your frontend expectations
    const place = response.data.result;
    
    res.json({
      name: place.name,
      rating: place.rating,
      url: place.url,
      reviews: place.reviews,
      fetched_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching Google reviews:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch reviews' });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
2. Update React Query Configuration
Update your React Query hook to properly fetch from your API:
javascriptconst { data, isLoading, isError } = useQuery<ReviewsData>({
  queryKey: ['/api/reviews'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/reviews');
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch reviews');
    }
    return response.json();
  },
  staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
});
3. Handle Edge Cases
Make sure your component properly handles cases where:

The API returns fewer reviews than expected
Reviews have missing fields
Different formatting for dates or profile photos
