Please overwrite the entire current “Explore Our Attractions” section of the Waterland Resort & Waterpark website. Replace all previous design and content elements with the following updated version. The new layout should be interactive, mobile-friendly, and visually consistent with Waterland’s premium summer resort identity.

Use clickable cards or blocks, each containing:
	•	A bold title
	•	A short teaser description
	•	A thumbnail or icon
	•	On click: opens a detailed view or modal with the full attraction info

Keep the design clean, spaced, and aligned with Waterland’s branding (aqua blue, white, and tropical orange). Prioritize readability and intuitive navigation.
