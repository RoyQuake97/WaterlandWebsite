Please redesign the current Admin Dashboard UI to follow a clean, modern, and professional layout. Apply the following improvements:

🔧 UI/UX Fixes:
1. Overall Styling
Use a light background (#F9FAFB) with a soft shadow card layout for all content blocks.

Apply a consistent padding and spacing system (use 16px or 24px spacing scale).

Use a clean font like Inter or Lato for clarity and a premium look.

2. Top Navigation
Replace the plain top bar with a white sticky navbar.

Add a small Waterland logo on the left.

Move the "Dashboard" and "Logout" buttons to the right in a cleaner row with modern button styles.

3. Table View Improvements
Place the "Reservations" title and "Add Reservation" button on the same horizontal row with spacing.

Add clear table borders, alternating row colors (#F5F7FA), and better column spacing.

Group check-in/check-out dates into a single cell titled "Stay Dates".

Replace the current “Paid” button with a toggle switch or badge and ensure status chips (like “Pending”) are colored with soft greens/yellows and rounded.

Add profile avatars or initials in guest column.

4. Calendar View Enhancements
Add color-coded event bars for each room type.

Include a hover tooltip to show full reservation details.

Enable switching between Day/Week/Month with larger, more intuitive buttons.

Highlight today’s date with a light blue circle.

Ensure better spacing between calendar rows and mobile responsiveness.

5. Form/Modal Consistency
Redesign the “Add Reservation” modal with stepper progress (1. Guest Info → 2. Room → 3. Dates → 4. Confirm).

Use clear field titles and dropdowns styled with rounded inputs and placeholder text.

Add error handling and field validation UI cues.

6. Responsive Design
Ensure all views work perfectly on mobile and tablet screens.

Use cards instead of tables on mobile, with key details stacked vertically.

🎨 Design Inspiration
Follow the style of platforms like Notion, Linear, or Vercel Dashboard — minimal, modern, and intuitive.
