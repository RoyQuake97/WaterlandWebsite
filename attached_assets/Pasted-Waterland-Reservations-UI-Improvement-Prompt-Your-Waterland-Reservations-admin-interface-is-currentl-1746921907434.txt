Waterland Reservations UI Improvement Prompt
Your Waterland Reservations admin interface is currently functional but lacks modern design principles and user experience optimizations. This prompt will guide you through transforming it into a professional, intuitive system that both looks better and improves workflow efficiency.
Current UI Issues

Outdated Visual Design: The interface uses a basic, utilitarian design that lacks visual appeal and hierarchy
Poor Information Architecture: Data is presented in a flat, unintuitive way with repetitive information
Limited Visual Feedback: Status indicators (like "Pending") are basic text without clear visual differentiation
Inefficient Layout: Table rows waste space with repetitive information (same check-in/out dates)
Missing Context: No overview metrics or data visualization to understand business performance
Limited Functionality: Basic CRUD without advanced filtering or batch operations
Poor Mobile Responsiveness: Interface doesn't adapt well to different screen sizes

Improvement Guidelines
